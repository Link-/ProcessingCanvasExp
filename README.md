<h1>Processing Canvas Exp</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This repo is intended to contain my personal experiments with Processing.js, HTML5 Canvas and Particle Systems. This repo is by no way intended to be used for the publishing of re-usable code. What I have here is a compilation of
quickly written code, some of is well documented, the rest might be spaghetti.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Feel free to use this code in whichever way you see fit.

<h4>Keyboard</h4>
After running index.html or the PDE:
<ul>
	<li>Mouse Click: Changes the flocking center point to new mouse position\coordinates</li>
	<li>UP: Add a Particle</li>
	<li>DOWN: Remove a Particle</li>
	<li>'s': Increase Speed of flocking</li>
	<li>'d': Decrease Speed of flocking</li>
	<li>'c': Change color of particles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The content of the <b>PDEs</b> folder require Processing v1.2+</li>
  <li>The rest should be regular HTML\Javascript code, any HTML5 enabled browser would do</li>
</ul>
